Search
- Multiple search is possible
- for date filter, user can choose to specify only start or end dates
  > if end is specified but start isn't, then start is defined as the current date
  > if start is specified but end isnt, then end is defined as 100 years into the future. this should allow for all listings.
- similar to bedroom and price fields, if one limit is not set it is automatically set to maximum or minimum possible value (that makes sense)
