We aimed to improve UI/UX design through several methods as outlined in the course lectures.

# Our UX Approach
We aim to maximise users' experience from interacting with our website through effectiveness and structured control. Our solution is well structured, allowing users to easily learn and navigate themselves through it. It is effective with high utility, such that the user is able to achieve their goal as quickly as possible in the simplest manner. 

# Our UI Approach
We aim to maximise users' aesthetic experience when interacting with our website through extensive but contemplated use of typography, color palettes, patterns and imagery. Using common patterns and associable objects allow us to produce a minimal design so as to not overload users with information and allow them to focus on the website's products. Good website structure and design also allows for seamless reactive display for variable screen widths. 

## Methods
### 1. Graphics Design
1.1. Standardised color palette. Using the dark blue header as a base, we theme the colors of the website using colors of the same hue. 
1.2. 'Grid' alignmnet of items. To make the design more consistent and easy on the eye , we use use a grid format for items on the listings pages. This makes each listing easily identifiable, and allows for a more seamless reactive display when screen size is changed.
1.3. Standard fonts. Text is easy on the eye and not all over the place.

### 2. Visual Heirarchy
2.1. Font sizes and styles are used appropriately to reflect the purpose and context of the text. For example, headers or titles are larger and may be bold. 
2.2. Contrast is used, albeit sparingly to draw attention to different segements on the page which we believe are important to the user.
2.3. Alignment. Our design focuses heavily on standardised alignment to ensure that all items are easily distinguishable from the other. 

### 3. Affordances
3.1. Explicit. Buttons which lead the user to perform some action are mostly explicitly defined. E.g. Log in, Log out, Register, Details, Back, etc..
3.2. Pattern. Buttons on pages have a common pattern (blue text, capitalised, with border). This allows the user to subconciously identify such buttons as actionable items.
3.2. Contrast.(Similar to 2.2 and 3.1.) When content is unavailable, we use contrast in the color of buttons to explicitly show the user that there is nothing there. 

### 4. Efficiency, Effectiveness and Utility
4.1. All interactions are simplifled and can be performed with the minimal number of steps. 
4.2. Important control objects are accessible to the user on all pages (NavBar)
4.3. Information and items are provided where the user would need it, based on their intended goals. 

### 5. Safety and Learnability
5.1. The website is simple and straightforward to learn.
5.2. All objects are evenly spaced and aligned to help the user avoid any errors.
