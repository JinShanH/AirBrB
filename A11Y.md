We followed the standard guidelines for Accessibility when designing our website. 
1. Perceivability
- Images have alt texts where applicable to describe the image. 
- Images are only used where necessary to prevent the page from looking too chaotic
- Texts on all pages are legible, and do not overlap with other rendered items. All text segments are clearly distinguished and well presented.

2. Operability
- Users are able to scroll through pages using keys
- For individual listings, our website offers an automated slide of all uploaded images. While there are more than one image, each image is displayed to the user for a sufficient period of time (about 3 seconds) which is neither too short nor too long. The user can also choose to go back to an image if they wish to view it longer.
- Our website has no flashy items which may cause discomfort to some users
- We chose to use a blue on white theme which is easy on the eyes. 
- Our website layout is well-structured with clearly defined navigation controls on each page. 

3. Understandable
- All headers and content are logically placed, with a simple and clearly defined flow. 
- All text used is as simple as possible (unless it is listing information described by the user) to enable quick understanding of site content
- When a user is required to enter some fields in a certain way, they are presented with a straightforward error message to notify them of the actions to take.

4. Robust
- All HTML code is parser-compliant.
- MUI and Native React libraries have been used which comply with the aforementioned
- Labels, id, and attributes etc are kept as relevant as possible
- All interactive elements are associated with their individual roles/tags
- No deprecated/outdated code is used (e.g. installed a newer and more up-to-date library written to replace react-swipable-views)
